        <h1> Research Supporting the Readefined </h1>
        <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood. Children with ADHD may be overly active or have trouble controlling impulsive behaviors. </p>
        <p>More importantly, children with ADHD may find it difficult to pay attention. Often continuing long into adulthood, the symptoms of ADHD – such as constant daydreaming, forgetfulness, or squirming and fidgeting – pose challenges for children at school, at home, or with friends.</p>
        <p>“Their inability to focus and concentrate may make it harder for them to visually track information and retain what they just read, so both their reading speed and comprehension can suffer,” points out Dr. Judy Ho, board certified clinical neuropsychologist and a psychology professor at Pepperdine University.</p>
        <p>In a paper published by Visser et al, it is reported that as early as 2007, 8.7% of children living in Vermont had a current ADHD diagnosis, ranking 23rd nationwide in children with ADHD diagnosis. In the next four years, the percentage of ADHD diagnoses in Vermont continued to rise, with an annual increase of 4%.</p>
        <p>Readefined is a scientifically-backed website that improves reading speed by silencing subvocalization and reducing unnecessary eye movement. In contrast to the average reading speed of 200 words per minute, readers, with the help of Readefined, are able to push their limits by doubling, or even tripling, their reading speed. </p>
