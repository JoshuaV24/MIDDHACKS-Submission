# MIDDHACKS-Submission

Readefined is a website that helps children with ADHD read faster immediately. Our backend is controlled with django and our front end with html, css, and javascript. We did not have time to complete all the functionality so we included prototype files that would've eventually made it into our final website.

1).Django:
  -We rendered the various pages of our website using django. We had no prior experience with it so it took us a while to figure out how it worked. 
  -To run the server, you need to cd into the fastread folder and then write python manage.py runserver in the command line.
  -Our home page is at the url that gets generated plus a /readefined
  -Our contact page is at /readefined/contact
  -Our research page is at /readefined/research
  
 2).Front end:
  -Each of the pages are of course written in html and css.
  -We included javascript files that atttempt to link the front and back end. 
  -The javascript adds functionality to our website.
  
 3)Prototype files:
   -Our algorithms were originally written in plain python. We did not have the time to fully implement them into javascript/django.
   
  4)Algorithms:
  We built two main set of functions. One set of functions were used to convert a pdf file into a txt file so that it can be read by our second set of functions which takes a txt file, converts it into an array and spits out words at a controllable, but default speed of 400wpm.

While, we did not complete building our web application, we request to be evaluated on the quality of our algorithm, the extent to which we were able to apply unfamiliar technologies, such as javascript and django, and the creativity of our approach. 

Regardless, we all collectively agree that this experience has been incredibly educational. By working under such a time constraint to build a captivating project, we were able to expedite our learning within the past two days. We are all incredibly thankful for the experience, especially as first years participating at a hackathon for the first time.
